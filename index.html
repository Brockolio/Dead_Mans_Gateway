                    Deep in the murky woods, far from civilization now, is a house.
                    Not a comfortable safety of our modern appliances and neighbors,
                    but a rotting shell of the failed beginnings of a society, haunted
                    by the past's sins. Whether it'd be from curiosity, a dare, ghost
                    hunting, or sheer stupidity, you found this place. You step out of
                    the muck, onto the front porch. Your next choice is up to youâ€¦
